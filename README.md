- This is a website I am building for a client as a freelance developer.
- As it is a work in progress, the live site does not contain up-to-date content as this will change throughout development.
- I host revision sessions with the client where we discuss their desires for design and content, and I provide an agile sprint utilising tools such as an ERD, kanban board and previews of the tools I use such as FluidUI and Figma.
